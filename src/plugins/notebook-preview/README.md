### Jupyter Notebooks Previewer

Triggers on type `['SoftwareSourceCode', 'Entity']`.

In order for the plugin to work, resources must contain `url` in the payload.

For the files stored on Github, it should be an url to a raw file, for example:

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlueBrain/nexus-forge/master/examples/notebooks/use-cases/Blue%20Brain%20Knowledge%20Graph.ipynb`
